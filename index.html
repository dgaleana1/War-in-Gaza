        <h1> War in Gaza </h1>
        <p id="p1"> AlJazeera <i>reports</i> that "Israel’s <b>deadly</b> bombardment of Gaza has killed nearly <i> 15,000 people </i>, including 10,000 women and children, in over 50 days, making it the <b>deadliest</b> war for the besieged Palestinian enclave <b>till date.</b>" <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/palestine-and-israel-brief-history-maps-and-charts" >(AlJazeera, 2023) </a> </p>
        <p id="p2"> Reuters <i>contextualizes</i> that in 1948, "As British colonial rule came to an end in Palestine in the late 1940s, violence intensified between Jews and Arabs, culminating in war between the newly created State of Israel and its Arab neighbours in May 1948."And later, "Tens of <i>thousands</i> of Palestinians took refuge in Gaza after <b>fleeing</b> or being driven from their homes. The invading Egyptian army had seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles (40 km) long, which ran from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon. The influx of <i>refugees</i> saw Gaza's population <b>triple</b> to around 200,000." <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/brief-history-gazas-centuries-war-2023-10-13/"> (Reuters, 2023)</a></p>
